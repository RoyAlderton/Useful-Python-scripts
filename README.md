# Useful-Python-scripts
Various Python scripts I've written, mostly for text processing and dealing with Praat TextGrids as part of the [Speakers, Listeners, Languages project](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/research/current_projects/ahrc_dfg_2021.html) at the [Institute of Phonetics and Speech Processing](https://www.en.phonetik.uni-muenchen.de/index.html) at [Ludwig-Maximilian University of Munich](https://www.lmu.de/en/index.html).
